On my path as a Junior Web Developer I am determined to always continue to learn. With this Meditation App the focus for learning was the use of Vanilla JavaScript through the following items:

```
document.querySelector()   //returns the first Element within the document that matches the specified selector

document.querySelectorAll()  //this method returns all elements that matches a CSS selector(s)

.addEventListener()  //method allows you to set up functions to be called when a specified event happens,

.getAttribute() //method returns the value of an element's attribute. 
```
